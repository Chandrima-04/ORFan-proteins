For the GOS data, I have the list of the GOS-only clusters and their
seqs in the file ~/dave2/GOS/quickload_run/gos_only_clusters+seqs.ids.

I created a file of just the seqids:
$ cut -f2 gos_only_clusters+seqs.ids > gos_only_seqs.ids

And fed that to xdget to obtain the FASTA seqs:
$ xdget -nf ../pred_prot_gos_orf_dna gos_only_seqs.ids -o gos_only.fa

And then wrote tab2clusterfa, which takes the gos_only_clusters+seqs.ids
file and the gos_only.fa file, and creates and individual FASTA file
for each cluster.
